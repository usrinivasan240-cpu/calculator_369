    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure data isolation and easy management of user-specific calculation histories. It leverages path-based ownership to enforce strict access control, ensuring that users can only access their own calculation data. This approach eliminates the need for complex security rules that involve `get()` operations, thus achieving Authorization Independence. The segregation of data into user-specific subcollections directly supports QAPs by preventing unauthorized access to other users' calculation histories, and by enabling efficient listing and querying of calculation histories for a specific user."
